                Documill Leap is the company's answer to enhance collaboration when preparing complex documents. 
                It offers simultaneous multi-user text editing, custom approval process, and digital document signing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this portfolio of mine, I cannot share pictures and details of how Documill Leap was built.
                Instead, I will describe how I contributed in different phases of the product.
            </p>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the company as a UX/UI Developer. Together with stakeholders and a UX designer, we did researches and brainstormings 
                about how to enhance the way people can work together to write documents.                
            </p>
            <p>
                I helped to validate the ideas by building wireframes using Gliffy Diagram and put them into InVision,
                as well as interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>

                        <td className="px-2">:</td>
                        <td>Gliffy Diagram, InVision</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><h3>Technologies</h3></td>
                        <td className="px-2">:</td>
                        <td>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                
            </table>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                After many of the ideas and designs were approved, a colleague and I started the actual development of Documill Leap.
                I handled the front-end development, while my colleague built the back-end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the time, more people were added into the project.
                So it was the right decision to use Git from the beginning of the development.

            <h2>Becoming Development Project Manager</h2>
            <p>
                When the project manager decided to move to another company, 
                I took the chance to step up and fill in the role.
                I took the responsibility for the product documentation, managing the development tasks,
                and ensuring that the project keeps rolling.
                Besides that, I am also still involved in front-end development.
                
            </p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><h3>Tools</h3></td>
                        <td className="px-2">:</td>
                        <td>JIRA, Confluence</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                
            </table>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Building Support Page</h2>
            <p>
                Just like any other products, Documill Leap also needs a Support Page;
                a website for the end-user which explains how the product works.                
            </p>
            <p>
                I researched both the concepts around writing a good support page
                and the latest tools to build the support page. 
                I also involved in writing the content of the support page.
            </p>

                        <td className="px-2">:</td>
                        <td>Confluence, Scroll Viewport</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                
            </table>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Further iterations</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I am responsible to ensure that product development keeps going,
                process the feedback into documentations and tasks, as well as new features.
